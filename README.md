## Quick Start

To start using the components in your project, you can refer the following code in your  `<link>` tags or directly use in your css files
```html
     <link 
        rel="stylesheet" 
        href="http://https://traquil-ui.netlify.app/styles.css"
    /> 
```
```css
    @import url("http://https://traquil-ui.netlify.app/styles.css");
```

Most of the components like Alerts, Ratings, Modal, Toast etc, require the use of JavaScript to function. For using that add the reference of the js files in `<script>` near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. For example :-

```html
     <script 
        src="http://https://traquil-ui.netlify.app/js/main.js">
    </script>
```
